//! A small software mixer on top of cpal: voices with per-sample linear resampling (pitch),
//! gain, looping and Omsi.exe's 3D model (inverse-distance attenuation beyond a `[3d]`
//! sound's range, a pan of a few dB - see [`pan_gains`]).
//!
//! The game and the mixer share no lock: the game's calls (any thread, `AudioEngine` is
//! `Send + Sync`) put commands into a lock-free ring and keep their own list of the voices
//! playing; the mixer (`render`, on the device's callback) owns the voices, takes the
//! commands in at the start of each block and hands the voices that ended back through a
//! second ring, so that their clips are let go of on the game's side (see `render`). The
//! device's stream lives on a thread of its own (`device`).
