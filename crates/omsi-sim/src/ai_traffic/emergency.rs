//! Emergency vehicles on an active drive, and the traffic making way for them.
//!
//! A vehicle is on an active drive while its script sets `TrafficPriority` above a half
//! (Omsi.exe reads it so every tick, 0x7d531b) and it is no timetable vehicle - a timetable
//! bus's scripts use the variable for something else. The player's vehicle and a LAN
//! player's are emergency vehicles by the same variable of theirs.
//!
//! Omsi.exe has the cars in front of one drive on as if they had priority themselves,
//! through red lights and over the limit; nobody pulls over. Here the drivers do what the
//! road traffic rules ask of them instead:
//! - only the vehicles on the emergency vehicle's actual way ahead react - its lane and the
//!   parallel lanes of the same carriageway, within `horizon` of its front - not a road that
//!   only runs nearby; a car is let go once the emergency vehicle has passed it;
//! - they make way (`emergency_way`, through the one owner of sideways moves, `lateral`): on a
//!   road of several lanes the innermost lane moves inward and the others outward, which
//!   opens a corridor between the innermost lane and the one beside it; on a road of one lane
//!   the car moves to the kerb, within its lane. The whole move is checked first (bodies,
//!   people, scenery); the car rolls at walking pace while it moves over and then waits. A
//!   car in a junction or on a ring drives on and clears the way;
//! - the emergency vehicle takes the corridor once the bodies have made room (`corridor`),
//!   and goes round a car standing aside for it on a road of one lane over the other half of
//!   the road, waiting for the oncoming traffic like anybody else (`planning::plan_pass`);
//! - a junction it comes to (within `RESERVE_REACH`, or one it is in) is kept for it: the
//!   lanes of the junction's object and those crossing them (`Reservation`). Whoever has
//!   not claimed a way through it yet waits at the entry - but for the vehicles ahead of it
//!   on its way, which lead it through (and cross with it), and the traffic on a ring. It
//!   may cross against a red light on the movement kept for it, at `CRAWL` at most; it still
//!   waits for whoever is in the junction already or has decided to go, for people on the
//!   crossing and for room on its exit, however long that takes. The junction is kept until
//!   its rear (its last section's) is out, or until it turns away, goes or the network
//!   changes.
//! - its speed: the limit times `EMERGENCY_LIMIT_FACTOR`, at most `EMERGENCY_LIMIT_PLUS`
//!   km/h over it, within its own top speed (`AiState::priority_drive`).
//!
//! Everything is worked out once at the start of a step from where everybody stands then
//! (`emergency_begin_step`), so neither the order the cars plan in nor the frame rate
//! changes who makes way.
