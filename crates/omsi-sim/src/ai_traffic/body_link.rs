//! The body owns the pose: after every step the planner looks for where its car's body
//! really stands on the way it laid out, and keeps to it. The planner integrates its own
//! place along the lanes and the body (`ai_motion::AiBody`) follows that place; nothing
//! told the planner when the body could not follow - held back by a wall it was not let
//! into, pushed back by a blow, standing off its way after a recovery - and the plan ran on
//! along the lanes, deciding everything for a place the car was not at, until the body was
//! eight metres behind and was put back onto the way by force.
//!
//! The body's rotation point is projected onto a short window of the planner's way (the
//! same curve the steering follows, with its joints smoothed, a lane change blended and a
//! bay's offset in it: during a lane change both lanes' places are reconciled together, as
//! the way blends them). The projection is refused where the body is too far beside the
//! way, turned too far from it, or on another level - a road beside or under the car's own
//! does not take the body over. What it finds goes to the planner as `AiState::body`: the
//! command starts from the body's speed while the body lags, and the plan waits for the
//! body `BODY_MAX_LEAD` metres ahead of it (`AiState::drive`).
