//! Who may come onto the road now. What the map, the timetable and the view would like on
//! the road (the demand, worked out by the population) is kept apart from whether a vehicle
//! may be put somewhere now (admission): a road and a way on from there, loaded ground, a
//! gap to whatever is there, nobody to see it appear.
//!
//! Requests wait in a bounded queue and are looked at in the order they came, a bounded
//! number per pass, so a pass costs the same whatever is asked and decides the same in
//! every run. A request is admitted, refused for good (`Denial`: no room in its class's
//! budget, no way, no ground) or left for a later pass (`Retry`: in sight, no gap - a gap
//! counts the vehicles admitted earlier in the same pass too, so two never land on one
//! spot). A place that keeps being refused (an entrance with a queue standing in it) is not
//! asked again for a while: it does not pile up requests.
//!
//! Each class has a budget of its own: the timetable's vehicles (`[AIMaxCountScheduled]`),
//! the random street traffic, the parked cars pulling out, aircraft, the dormant cars
//! waking up. Only the host of a LAN session (or a game on its own) decides who is on the
//! road: a client draws what the host sends (`TrafficSim::mirror`).
