//! The bodies and the scenery: an AI vehicle keeps out of the map's collision boxes and
//! meshes (the player's collision world, `TrafficSim::occluders`) instead of driving
//! through them.
//!
//! Every quarter of a second a car looks along its way: the body is driven ahead along the
//! way by its own steering (`AiBody::predict` - the rate-limited wheel and the pure pursuit
//! that cuts a bend, not the way's centre line), each pose a box from 15 cm over the road
//! (the road surface and the kerbs are no walls) up to the vehicle's roof, the sections of an
//! articulated bus or a trailer each about its own coupling (`Shape::follow`, the joint
//! stopping at its `[coupling_front_character]` angle) rather than one long box that swings
//! its tail wide. The first pose that touches something is the distance to contact, and the
//! car stops short of it (`STOP_SHORT`), braking for it as for a line - before the thing,
//! not against it.
//!
//! A contact at the side (a corner of the body meeting a post, a house's corner on a tight
//! turn) is first steered round: the way is nudged within the lane by 0.35, 0.6 or 0.2 m
//! away from it (at a junction or on a turning lane up to a metre, a wide vehicle up to
//! 0.6 m past the lane's edge), each candidate driven ahead the same way and checked against
//! the scenery and the other vehicles' bodies. The nudge is a steering request, the body
//! still drives there itself.
//!
//! What the look ahead missed, the step catches: a step of the body that takes it deeper
//! into something is taken back (the body stands where it was, its wheels still turned as
//! the step turned them) and the body recovers - it steers with the look-ahead distance,
//! from half to one and a half of the usual, that frees the corner best. The planner waits
//! for the body meanwhile (`body_link`).
//!
//! The AI of Omsi.exe does not know the scenery at all; a map can lay a path through an
//! object. A car that stood `PATIENCE` seconds for one thing gives it up, and so does every
//! car after it: it drives through as Omsi.exe's would rather than block the road for good.
