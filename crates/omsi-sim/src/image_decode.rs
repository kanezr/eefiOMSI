//! Reading picture files for the simulation: the bitmaps a script loads into its script
//! texture (`STLoadTex`), the font sheets of the text textures, the pictures of the HTML
//! pages, the look of a paint scheme's stand-in texture.
//!
//! The simulation does not decode pictures itself: that is the presentation's texture
//! loading (omsi-texture), which the simulation must not depend on. The game registers its
//! decoder once at start ([`install`]); everything here asks it through [`decode`]. The
//! pictures only come back as RGBA, which is all the simulation reads of them.
